## What is IlanaORM?

**√ål√†n√†** (pronounced "ee-LAH-nah") is a Yoruba word meaning "pattern," "system," or "protocol."

IlanaORM is a fully-featured, Eloquent-style Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js that makes database interactions simple and intuitive. Think of it as a bridge between your JavaScript/TypeScript code and your database.

## Why Choose IlanaORM?

### üöÄ **Easy to Learn**

If you're new to ORMs, IlanaORM uses simple, English-like methods that make database operations intuitive:

```javascript
// Instead of writing SQL like this:
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18 AND is_active = true

// You write this:
const users = await User.query()
  .where("age", ">", 18)
  .where("is_active", true)
  .get();
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safe**

Automatic TypeScript support means fewer bugs and better developer experience:

```typescript
const user = await User.find(1); // TypeScript knows this is a User instance
user.name = "John"; // ‚úÖ Valid
user.invalidProperty = "test"; // ‚ùå TypeScript error
```

### üîó **Powerful Relationships**

Define how your data connects with simple relationship methods:

```javascript
class User extends Model {
  posts() {
    return this.hasMany("Post"); // A user has many posts
  }
}

// Load user with all their posts
const user = await User.with("posts").find(1);
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Complete Toolkit**

Everything you need for database management:

- **Models** - Represent your data
- **Migrations** - Version control for your database
- **Seeders** - Populate your database with test data
- **Factories** - Generate realistic fake data
- **Query Builder** - Build complex queries with ease
